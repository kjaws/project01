  <h1>my experience</h1>
  <p>
    <p><em>What did you find challenging about this project?</em></p>
      <p class="response">The most challenging part for me was creating the responsive grid. In the intro level web design and development class, I did not learn Bootstrap, or any other grid system. I had issues combining the image and information within the same continer, considering many of the artist's names and titles of work were longer than the others. Once I decided I wanted to make each image a sqaure in an equal grid, and add a key at the bottom relating to each piece, it was much easier.</p>

    <p><em>What did you find interesting about this project?</em></p>
      <p class="response">I actually didn't know you could validate your code to check for errors, so that was interesting. I enjoyed experimenting with opacity in the navigation bar and the main white background on each page. I wanted to display the background photos (all taken by me), yet still creating a clean, readable design.</p>

    <p><em>Were there any techniques you learned by doing this project?</em></p>
      <p class="response">I learned a lot about that grid system, which still seems oddly more complicated than I'd expect it to be. Regardless, it's a good technique to know for laying out a page. I learned more about hover transitions on my art page, and I'm happy with the outcome of border and brightness transition. I also learned about the z-index: at one point my fixed navigation bar was hidden under my images on my art page when you scrolled down. Clearly I couldn't keep that, having some menu options unclickable and hidden. Such an easy fix! </p>

    <p><em>Did you try anything out and have to delete it because it just wasnâ€™t working?</em></p>
      <p class="response">I had the idea to make the arrow in the top right corner clickable to bring you to an anchor further down the page, but the code to make that happen was more complicated than I expected. I like what I came up with instead, though.</p>

    <p><em>How would you improve a portion of this project?</em></p>
      <p class="response">I'd love to improve my grid. I am satisfied with what I came up with, and although it is responsive when you resize the window, I couldn't figure out the breakpoints to shoot a 3x3 grid to become one multi-rowed column. It still works to an extent, but I'd like it better if that responsiveness was cleaner. I also had other ideas I would've liked to implement. For example, I thought of a left floating grid along a right floating key. Also when you'd hover over an image, the corresponding information would bold or highlight to make it clear which artist went with which work of art.</p>
